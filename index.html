		<h2>Biography</h2>
		<h3>Elementary Bio</h3>
		<p>I went to <em>Colonel Nichols</em>, then I went to <em>Hart Elementary</em>. I enjoyed my second elementary school more than the first. 
		When I got transferred to the new school the kids were just 'eh'. There wasn't anything special  about the kids there. 
		The only major difference was that the new school did not have a dress code, which was awesome.</p>
		<h3>Jr. High Bio</h3>
		<p>I went to <em>Actis Jr. High</em>. My grandparents knew the VP personally so I <strong>never</strong> got in trouble.
		My favorite teacher was probably my English and reading teacher teacher, Mr. Johnson. There were very few kids that went there that I went to elementary school with, so I had to meet new people.</p>
		<h3>High School Bio</h3>
		<p>West is ok. Much like from elementary to Jr High, not many kids from my Jr. High came to my high school. 
		My oldest friend from Jr. High does come to my high school, however, and my oldest friend from this school still goes here.</p>
